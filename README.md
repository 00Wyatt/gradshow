# Grad Show
This is a WordPress theme developed at North Metropolitan TAFE. The project is for showcasing the work of graduating students in Semester 1 of 2023.

## Overview
As a team, we have designed and developed a WordPress website to showcase the work of graduating students from North Metropolitan TAFE in Semester 1 of 2023. The Grad Show website aims to provide a platform for students to showcase their work and connect with potential employers and industry professionals.

Using Figma, we designed a visually appealing and user-friendly interface that highlights the students' diverse talents and skills. We are now utilizing WordPress to provide a flexible and scalable platform for managing and updating the website's content.

We are committed to delivering a high-quality website that effectively represents the graduating students and helps them launch their careers.

## Functionality:
This theme is designed to be used at the Grad Show to showcase diploma students and their projects that they have completed at TAFE.
There are four main pages:
-	A Home page that includes a heading section with the site title, and a Projects section displaying a list of all of the projects.
-	A Project page that displays information about an individual project, including an image, links, and which students worked on it.
-	A Developers page that displays a list of all the students who are involved in the projects, including links to their personal websites.
-	An About page that include information about the Grad Show, an image, and some info about the Diplomas that the students are currently completing.

When setting up this theme on website, a user is able to:
-	Add projects – with a description and a picture.
-	Add students – with a picture and a link to their personal website.
-	Link the students to a project – so they can be displayed on the project’s page.
-	Add a description and an image to the About page.
-	Add information about Diplomas at TAFE to the About page.
